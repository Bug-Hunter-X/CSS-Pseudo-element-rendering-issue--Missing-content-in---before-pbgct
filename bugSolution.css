To fix this, ensure you provide content for the pseudo-element using the `content` property.  Here's the corrected CSS:

```css
div::before {
  content: ''; /* or content: "Some text"; */
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```

Adding `content: '';` (or any other content) makes the pseudo-element visible and allows the border to be applied.
